# Blackjack Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This is a Python-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack.

## Game Rules

1. **Card Values**: In this game, the Jack, Queen, and King all count as 10 points. Aces can be counted as 1 point, depending on which value is more favorable to your hand.

2. **Card Removal**: Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn, so the same card can be drawn in consecutive rounds.

## How to Play
1. To start the game, run the provided Python script. Ensure you have a Python environment set up.

2. You will be playing against the computer. At the beginning of each round, both you and the computer are dealt two cards from the deck. The computer's second card is initially hidden.

3. During your turn, you can choose to "hit" (draw an additional card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).

4. The objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the computer's hand value without exceeding 21.

5. If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card, you achieve a "Blackjack" and instantly win the round.

6. If your hand value exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the round.

7. The computer will reveal its hidden card and take its turn based on a predefined set of rules.

8. The winner is determined based on the hand values. The one closest to 21 without busting wins. In the case of a tie, the round is considered a "push."

9. You can play multiple rounds, and the player with the most rounds won at the end is the overall winner.
